Sr. Solutions Architect and Innovation Technologist with a passion for Web 3 and Machine Learning (incl. Generative AI). I have a wide range of experience working with corporate innovation applying the ["Lean Startup"](https://www.ideo.com/journal/zig-then-zag-when-to-use-design-thinking-vs-the-lean-startup-approach) framework, from designing and developing innovative solutions to managing and deploying them. I specialize in leveraging emerging technologies to solve complex problems and have a track record of successful driving results using hypothesis-driven experimentation. My goal is to help drive transformative change to make a positive impact on the lives of people through innovative technologies.
